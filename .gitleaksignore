# Gitleaks ignore file for suppressing specific findings by fingerprint
#
# This file is for ignoring specific secret detections (false positives).
# When gitleaks finds a potential secret, it generates a fingerprint.
# Add that fingerprint here to suppress the finding.
#
# Format: <fingerprint-hash>
#
# To exclude files/patterns from scanning, use .gitleaks.toml instead.
